    [`bug 2105891 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystoneauth/+bug/2105891>`_]
    This change prevents ``client_id`` from appearing more than once per
    request, fixing a previous 401 error with Okta. Credentials should
    either be in the auth header, POST body, or a ``client_assertation``
    in the POST body. If the ``client_secret`` is set, it will be with
    ``client_id`` in the auth headers. If it is not, ``client_id`` will be
    added to the payload.
