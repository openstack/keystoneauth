# Requirements lower bounds listed here are our best effort to keep them up to

# All additions to this file must have significant justification.

# NOTE(morgan) At no time may any oslo library be added to the keystoneauth
# requirements. The requirements for keystoneauth are very tightly controlled
# to ensure we are not pulling in a ton of transient dependencies. This is
# important from the standpoint of ensuring keystoneauth can be used outside
# of openstack-specific projects (allowing interaction with openstack APIs)
# where oslo and associated transient dependencies are not desired.
